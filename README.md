301 Dart Calculator built for fun, as a learning experience, and to help myself score 301 and 501 dart games quickly without having to do mental math. Best viewed in a mobile layout.

It isn't a polished product - there's definitely more I'd like to do - mainly saving the status of the game to local storage. Don't accidentally close the window or refresh ;)

Someday I may rebuild it in React with all the features I hoped and dreamed of adding.
